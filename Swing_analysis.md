# Swing limits of 2 stage Miller compensated op amp

Swing limit analysis of 2 stage Miller compensated op amp.


First we look at input swing limits (input common mode range, or input bias range).

* For the **input swing limits**, the limiting factors are exactly the same devices as in the single stage op amp (differential pair with current mirror load) and by exactly the same mechanisms, so this is **exactly the same as in the single stage op amp**.

* For the **output swing limits**, the output can have a large signal swing all the way from a VDSAT above ground (M12) and a VDSAT below supply (M11).
